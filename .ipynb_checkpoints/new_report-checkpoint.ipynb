    "  Provided by the [Australian Bureau of Statistics](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/business-indicators/counts-australian-businesses-including-entries-and-exits/latest-release#data-downloads). This file contains business counts by industry and turnover range for each SA2. The `total_businesses` field was used to calculate business density per 1,000 people in selected sectors.\n",

    "- **Income**  \n",
    "  Sourced from the [Canvas](https://canvas.sydney.edu.au/courses/62985/files/40497761?module_item_id=2534409). Includes variables such as `median_income` by SA2. These fields were used to assess the economic situation of each region.\n",

    "- **Population**  \n",
    "  Sourced from [Canvas](https://canvas.sydney.edu.au/courses/62985/files/40497767?module_item_id=2534407), reports population counts by age groups. Fields including `total_people` and youth segments (`10_14_people`) were used to support normalization and school-related metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stops**  \n",
    "  Sourced from [Transport for NSW](https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/dataset/timetables-complete-gtfs). Includes public transport stops with geographic coordinates and SA2 codes. Stop counts were calculated per region.\n",

    "  Provided by the [NSW Department of Education](https://data.cese.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/school-intake-zones-catchment-areas-for-nsw-government-schools). Includes shapefiles for primary, secondary, and future school catchment zones. These spatial layers were used to evaluate school accessibility.\n",

    "- **POI**  \n",
    "  Extracted using the [NSW Points of Interest API](https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/nsw-points-of-interest-poi/resource/f4b643b4-a872-4b63-bbb5-5b768bacbc78). Contains locations of community facilities identified within each SA2 bounding box. Relevant POIs were counted to represent local amenity access."

    "To calculate the final score for each SA2 region, four indicators were chosen: **stops**, **schools**, **parks as POI**, and **businesses (retail industry)**. These factors were selected because they reflect important aspects of **local accessibility**, **education**, **community facilities**, and **economic activity**.\n",
